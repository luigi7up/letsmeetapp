# Let's MeetApp: Introduction
===========
Letsmeetapp is a smartphone based application that facilitates arranging a meeting between friends. 

## Problem & solution
===========
It’s probably happened few times that you wanted to arrange a meeting with your friends to have a coffee during 
a week or to go to the coast one weekend in July, but it seemed impossible to get them all in accordance. 
One is working until late, the other one is not in the city until Thursday the third one is doing his master 
presentation, the first one got fired in the middle of your communication and you realised that you simply 
can’t keep track about it. Don’t get me wrong, whatsapp, facebook or email are great tools, but they are not 
really helpful if it’s you who has to scroll up and down to collect all the information from your irrational 
friends.
The solution is quite simple: An app where one of you creates an event and sets the date range in which he/she 
wants this event to happen and invites the others by sending them an email. They all open the event calendar 
and say whichever of the days in the range suits them. As a result when invited people give their 
OKs it’s easy to decide when to meet...
